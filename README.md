IoT based weather station

Project Overview:
This project is an IoT-based weather monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller and multiple environmental sensors. It collects real-time data (temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, light intensity, and atmospheric pressure) and sends it to the Blynk IoT platform for remote monitoring. An LED alarm triggers when CO2 levels exceed 1000ppm.
